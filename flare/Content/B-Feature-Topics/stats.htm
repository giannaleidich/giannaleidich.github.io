        <h1>Digital Accessibility is Statistically Necessary</h1>
        <p>The idea that disability as an “outlier” is not uncommon. People who have disabilities are severely underrepresented in our media, and what representation that does exist can play into harmful stereotypes (Brevig). The lack of genuine representation can contribute to the idea that disability is the “exception.” But looking at the statistics paint a very different story and this module is going to explore that story in detail.</p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2022, more than 1 in 4 (28.1%) adults in the United States report having some type of disability (CDC). This is no percentage, especially when we consider that this equates to a population of roughly over 70 million adults. Cognitive disabilities—those that affect an individual’s ability to perform mental tasks—are the most common at 13.4%. This is followed by mobility, hearing, and vision, respectively (CDC). These disabilities impact multiple areas of a person’s existence, including their ability to interact with and use web content.</p>
        <p>To account for those with disabilities is to account for a substantial subset of the populace; because the volume of people who have a disability is so high, the design choices we make relating to accessibility are bound to impact and reach such individuals. It is imperative that accessibility is at the forefront of conversations around design because so many users are impacted. It may be the case that one might argue how it is possible to account for *all* disabilities. It is true that improving our design for one target audience may have negative consequences on another. What is important is that we are having these conversations and making important decisions around such concepts, rather than forgoing them altogether. Total accessibility is an ideal and one that we should strive to, if only so we can account for 28.1% of our user base.</p>
