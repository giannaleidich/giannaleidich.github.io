        <h1>Digital Accessibility is Lawful and Ethical</h1>
        <p>Digital accessibility is a form of inclusion: by designing our digital content to be as accessible to as many users are possible, we are accounting for an audience of diverse (dis)abilities. Users who have disabilities are included in the set of people who are able to easily access digital content and are therefore given equal access to it. In this module, we’re going to examine digital accessibility as a practice that is both lawful and ethical.</p>
        <p>In 1973, the Rehabilitation Act (Rehab Act) of 1973 was passed, and in it was Section 504 which specifically prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability in programs that received funding from federal agencies (Rights). The work and efforts done to pass this legislation was spearheaded by Judith Heumann, a civil rights activist and leader in the disability community, as well as other people with disabilities, many of whom were her former fellow campers at Camp Jened, a summer camp for people with disabilities (Crip Camp).</p>
        <p>Later in 1998, this work was continued when the Rehab Act was amended with Section 508 which mandated that federal agencies make digital content accessible to those with disabilities. A major component of Section 508 is enduring that digital content is accessible without “undue burden” (”Section508.Gov”). What this means is that digital content should immediately be accessible to all users: users who have disabilities should not have to undergo extra work just to achieve a level of access that others may instantly have. And, in the case where digital access is not immediate, Section 508 also rules that alternative means of access must also be implemented.</p>
        <p>What Section 508 essentially legislates is that digital content must be accessible by law. It is illegal for websites to contain content only accessible to certain individuals and not others. Therefore, designing for digital accessibility is lawful. And for some, that itself is enough a motivation to produce accessible web content. But we should also recognize and remember that digital accessibility is also a form of inclusion and therefore an ethical matter.</p>
        <p>To return to the work of Judith Heumann and the disabled community, it’s clear that the movement towards a more accessible environment (physically and digitally) is led by those most deeply impacted. When designing content, it is important to keep in mind that there are real people impacted by our choices. One of our most impactful choices are those we make regarding accessibility because they can very well dictate who can readily access and consume our content, and who cannot. And when we design for all users, we’re necessarily promoting inclusivity in our work, which is the ethical thing to do. Thus, digital accessibility is not only what we should strive for in compliance with the laws, but also something that we should emphasize to need the needs and goals of our users: real people who use and consume our digital content.</p>
