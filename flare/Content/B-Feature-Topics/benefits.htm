        <h1>Digital Accessibility Benefits Everyone</h1>
        <p>Digital accessibility is the practice of creating content to be usable for users who have disabilities, such that as many users as possible can be accommodated and included. Examples of this might look like designing text and background colors to have strong contrast, adding alternative text to images, and increasing the size of text that appears in paragraphs. These design choices, while specifically implemented to benefit users who have disabilities, also do not detract from the experience of those without. This module further argues that these and other features actually improve the usability and accessibility for all users, irrespective of their (dis)abilities (Kalbag 4).</p>
        <p>To return our initial example of designing text and background colors to have strong contrast. This is a design choice that targets users with visual disabilities by helping them to more-easily read and therefore consume textual content.</p>
        <p>Now recall an instance during which you were on a website that lacked this feature. Was it difficult to read? Did you understand what you were reading, or were you more focused on the act of reading itself, made more strenuous by this website’s poor design choice? While such an instance might have been an unusual annoyance for users without visual disabilities, it’s unfortunately the reality of many with visual disabilities. And unlike a singular website being the culprit, many websites—even ones that many might not regard as inaccessible—are at fault.</p>
        <p>In this case, the accessible design choice of heightened contrast would not only benefit users with disabilities, but also those without. We can clearly see how accessible design choices account for all users; furthermore, accessibility as a design practice is important because it benefits everyone, while at the same time emphasizing the needs of those with disabilities. That additional consideration, and the resultant design choices, are what ultimately creates a usable website for all types of users.</p>
