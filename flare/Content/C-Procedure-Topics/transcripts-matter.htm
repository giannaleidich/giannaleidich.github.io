        <h1>Why Transcripts Matter</h1>
        <p>A video’s transcript is the text version of that video. Any spoken words are transcribed verbatim, such that anyone who picks up the transcript can get an understanding of everything said during the video without actually listening to it. This is similar to captioning, but transcripts include more features to promote accessibility. For example, if there are unclear portions of the audio, a transcript will note and include this, whereas captions often times will this. Transcripts are also unique because they include timestamps that help the user follow along with the video while reading. This might look like a new time stamp each new sentence to ensure that the user can easily find their place throughout the video. And as a bonus, this can also help all users might locate a specific portion of the video, just by skimming the transcript.</p>
        <p>Transcripts are particularly important for users with visually impairments and cognitive disabilities. In the case of the former, transcripts can allow one to easily access and consume a video’s contents without audio; in the case of the latter, transcript can help one to find their spot in the video, easily locate portions to rewatch, and get a general understanding of its contents before or after watching. But as discussed in Digital Accessibility Benefits Everyone, everyone can benefit from transcripts and their availability.</p>
