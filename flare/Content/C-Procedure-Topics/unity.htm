        <h1>Unity Video Tutorial</h1>
        <p>The Unity cluster, more commonly referred to as simply Unity, is a high-performance computing cluster that facilitates the research of scientists, facilitators, and system administrations, by proving them with the resources necessary to perform intensive computing tasks, such as processing data and training AI machine learning models. For this project, I was responsible for creating a video tutorial that guides the viewer in submitting interactive and non-interactive jobs to Unity via the Unity OnDemand shell, a web-based command prompt, and Unity’s GUI. This video was developed over he course of two weeks in direct collaboration with Lauren Saloio, a Research Fellow at Unity responsible for maintaining its docs and managing communications. Saloio introduced me to the platform and my assignment, gave me direct feedback on the video, and helped troubleshoot whenever necessary. 

During filming, it was important to me that this video be accessible to a wide audience: clear directions, context when necessary, and a refined transcript were top priorities. Other additions, such as title cards and graphics, were also included to improve accessibility—for example, using the title cards to navigate throughout the video without necessarily watching it in its entirety—as well as add to the video’s design and aesthetics. To ensure that this video fit into Unity’s overall brand image, it both opens and closes with Unity’s logo and uses the platform’s colors—white, black, and green—were used throughout the video.</p>
