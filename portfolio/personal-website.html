        <h1>Creating This Website</h1>
        <div id="narrative-container">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This website is the final project for the software course of the professional writing and technical communications 
                certificate program. It was created using HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. You can read about my design process, including 
                the research, planning, implementation, and usability testing that went into creating this website.
            </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in my design process was to research and gather information from other designerâ€™s portfolio websites. 
                During this stage, I focused on visual design and noted what design features that I liked best and wanted to replicate 
                on my own website. 
            </p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>
                During the planning stage, I produced <a href="../pdfs/planning-doc.pdf" class="in-line-link">this planning document</a>, in which I define my audience and goals, as well as detail 
                my visual design choices and aesthetics, based on my prior research. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/planning-doc.png" alt="Beginning of doc plan.">
            </div>  
            

            <p>
                Also included in this doc plan were wireframes and a sitemap, to help guide my implementation and logical flow of the website. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe for Portfolio page.">
                <img src="../images/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap for website.">
            </div>

            
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <h3>Creating the Navbar</h3>
            <p>
                The first component that I implemented was the navbar, which is consistent across the entire website. I focused on layout, 
                readability, and responsiveness on a page resize. If the browser window gets too small, the links on the navbar stack due 
                to the limited width real estate. 
            </p>

            
            <img class="non-narrative-img-container" src="../images/navbar.png" alt="Navbar for the website.">
            
            <h3>Designing the Home page</h3>
            <p>
                After finalizing the navbar, I focused on slowly building the website page-by-page, naturally starting with the Home page. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/personal-website.png" alt="Website Home page.">
            </div>

            <p>
                This page was the most difficult to implement, because its structure is the most unique. The technique that I relied on 
                the most here was using grid because it allowed me to have specific control over where and how my elements appeared. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/sketch-spacers.jpeg" alt="Sketch of the grid.">
                <img src="../images/spacers.png" alt="CSS for spacers.">
            </div>

            <h3>Finishing the Remaining pages</h3>
            <p>
                The remaining pages were much more straightforward to implement. Each one has a similar structure, especially the 
                About Me and Contact pages. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/about-me.png" alt="About Me page.">
                <img src="../images/contact.png" alt="Contact Me page.">
            </div>

            <p>
                The only pages to give me real struggle were the Resume and Portfolio pages, due to their complicated layouts. 
                Again I used grid, and sometimes grids inside of grids. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/sketch-divs.jpeg" alt="Sketch of nested grids.">
                <img src="../images/divs.png" alt="HTML for divs.">
            </div>

            <p>
                I also decided to use JavaScript to add an image carousel on the Portfolio page to showcase my graphics and 
                add a bit of interactivity to the page. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/carousel.png" alt="Image carousel in action.">
                <img src="../images/javascript.png" alt="JavaScript code snapshot.">
            </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This website is the result of research, planning, implementing, and testing, done in several iterations. 
                To design and create a website that visually represents me as a designer and that is demonstrative of the 
                various skills that I bring to the table was my main goal in creating this website, and I believe that I have 
                achieved those goals.
