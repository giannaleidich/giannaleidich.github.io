        <h1>Creating This Website</h1>
        <div id="narrative-container">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This website is the final project for the software course of the professional writing and technical communications 
                certificate program. It was created using HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. You can read about my design process, including 
                the research, planning, and coding that went into implementing this website.
            </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in my design process was to research and gather information from other designer’s portfolio websites. 
                During this stage, I focused on visual design and noted what features that I liked best and most wanted to replicate 
                on my own website. 
            </p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>
                During the planning stage, I produced 
                <a href="../pdfs/planning-doc.pdf" class="in-line-link" aria-label="View the planning document.">this planning document</a>, 
                in which I define my audience, set my goals, and detail my visual design choices, based on my prior research. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/planning-doc.png" alt="Beginning of doc plan.">
            </div>  
            

            <p>
                Also included in this doc plan were wireframes and a sitemap to help guide my implementation and logical flow of the website. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe for Portfolio page.">
                <img src="../images/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap for website.">
            </div>

            
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <h3>Creating the Navbar</h3>
            <p>
                The first component that I implemented was the navbar, which is consistent across the entire website. I focused on layout, 
                readability, and responsiveness on a page resize.
            </p>

            <img class="non-narrative-img-container"  src="../images/navbar.png" alt="Navbar for the website.">

            <p>
                If the browser window gets too small, the links on the navbar stack due to the limited width real estate. This is also consistent
                throughout the website.
            </p>

            
            <img id="special-resize" class="non-narrative-img-container" src="../images/navbar-small.png" alt="Resized navbar for the website.">
            
            <h3>Designing the Home page</h3>
            <p>
                After finalizing the navbar, I focused on slowly building the website page-by-page. Naturally, I started with the Home page. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/personal-website.png" alt="Website Home page.">
            </div>

            <p>
                This page was the most difficult to implement because its structure is the most unique. I relied on using CSS grid the 
                most because it allowed me to have specific control over where and how my elements appeared. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/sketch-spacers.jpeg" alt="Sketch of the grid.">
                <img src="../images/spacers.png" alt="CSS for spacers.">
            </div>

            <h3>Finishing the Remaining pages</h3>
            <p>
                The remaining pages were much more straightforward to implement. Each one has a similar structure, especially the 
                About Me and Contact pages. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/about-me.png" alt="About Me page.">
                <img src="../images/contact.png" alt="Contact Me page.">
            </div>

            <p>
                The only pages to give me real struggle were the Resume and Portfolio pages, again due to their complicated layouts. 
                Again I used grid, and sometimes grids inside of grids. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/sketch-divs.jpeg" alt="Sketch of nested grids.">
                <img src="../images/divs.png" alt="HTML for divs.">
            </div>

            <p>
                I also decided to use JavaScript to add an image carousel on the Portfolio page to showcase my graphics and 
                add a bit of interactivity to the page. 
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-img-container">
                <img src="../images/carousel.png" alt="Image carousel in action.">
                <img src="../images/javascript.png" alt="JavaScript code snapshot.">
            </div>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Putting digital accessibility first was a forefront focus of this portfolio. I designed this website to be 
                “universally accessible,” that is, as accessible to the widest range of users, regardless of (dis)ability. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility features include alt text for all images, sufficient color contrast between text and background, 
                and ARIA labels where appropriate. 
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This website is the result of several iterations of researching, planning, and coding. To create a digital achieve for my 
                projects and demonstrate my web design skills were the main goals in creating this portfolio website, and I believe 
                that I have achieved those goals.
            </p>

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have tried to make a personal website several times before. This is the only one that came to fruition.</li>
                <li>I only used one color that was not black, gray, or white: slategray.</li>
                <li>
                    In the same semester I implemented this website, I had to implement websites for two other courses. This one was
                    my favorite to work on.
