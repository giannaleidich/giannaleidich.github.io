        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Gianna, a junior at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst 
            studying English and computer science, and completing the Professional 
            Writing and Technical Communications certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
            After entering UMass as a primary computer science major and taking 
            a course in human-computer interaction, I decided to center my studies 
            around information design and user experience research. I'm interested 
            in digital design, web development, and social media management and 
            marketing.

        <h1>My Goals</h1>
        <p>
            It is my goal to continue expanding my skills in web design and 
            development with a specific focus on digital accessibility. I believe 
            that good design and accessibility go hand in hand and all my projects, 
            including this very website, were created with that idea at the forefront. 
        </p>
