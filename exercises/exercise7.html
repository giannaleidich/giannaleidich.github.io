            <h2>Jabberwocky Instagram graphics</h2>
            <p>
                These are graphics created for the Jabberwocky—UMass Undergraduate Literary Journal—Instagram account

                a minimalistic design that highlights the most important information: what pieces can be submitted and 
                when the due date is.
