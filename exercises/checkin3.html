                After waking up and getting ready for the day, I headed to the ISB café to get a drink and read some poems for 
                Jabberwocky. I spent about an hour there before going to my discussions: discrete math and web development. I 
                had a call for my internship that I took in SEL, before meeting my friends to get lunch.

                After having lunch from Blue Wall, my friends and I went over to South College to get some work done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But before we could lock in, we obviously had to have some caffeine, so we put our stuff down and went to Woo Café 
                to get matcha and lattes. 
            </p>

                The picture to the right was me right after getting out drinks and thinking about all the work I had to 
                do… We all had a lot of upcoming assignments and exams, so it was important that we remained focused. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                We went back to South College after that and stayed there until it was dark.
